## Here are scripts that:
- Help set up and control argo
- Help set up and control rancher
- Promote efficiency when deploying microservices and do not want to wait for some CI job to complete
- Simplify accessing other tools via port forwarding instead of fighting with load balancers

## `infra-port-forward.sh`
Port forwards Argo and Rancher in the background (*wrapper script*)
